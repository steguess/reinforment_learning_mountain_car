# Reinforcement Learning Notebook 🤖

Reinforcement learning (RL) is the part of machine learning that deals with learning from interacting with an environment. In this report, we apply various methods of reinforcement learning to a controlled environment in OpenAI Gym. Let's dive in! 🌊

## Introduction

**OpenAI Gym** is a Python package comprising various **RL (Reinforcement Learning) environments**, including:

- 🧸 **Simple “Toy” Environments**: Simpler environments to help you start.
- 🤺 **Challenging Environments**: 
  - 🤖 **Simulated Robotics**: Emulating robotic tasks and challenges.
  - 🕹️ **Atari Video Games**: Train agents in environments simulating classic Atari video games.

OpenAI Gym offers different difficulty levels and complexities suitable for a range of RL tasks.

### Mountain Car Problem 🚗🏔️

#### Problem Description

- **Context**: A car between two “mountains”. The objective is to drive up the mountain on the right, but the car's engine isn't powerful enough in a single pass.
- **Challenge**: To oscillate and gain momentum.

This problem aptly suits reinforcement learning since it's a simple representation of real-world challenges.

#### Components

- **Agent**: The car 🚗.
- **Environment**: World with mountains 🏔️.
- **Action**: Move ➡️ right, ⬅️ left or 🚫.
- **State**: Car's position 📍 and velocity 🚀.
- **Reward**: -1 📉 for each step away from the flag 🏁; maximized when reached flag in minimal steps.

#### Objective

The aim is to maximize total rewards 📈 by reaching the flag 🏁 in the least steps. Read more [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/mountain_car/).
